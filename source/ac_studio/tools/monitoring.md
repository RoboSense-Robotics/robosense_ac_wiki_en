# Monitoring

Monitor some metrics of interest in ros2, such as: memory/CPU/IO usage, message frame rate, the difference between message timestamp and current system time, etc. The monitoring results will be output through logs and topics. At the same time, the software package also provides a python script to generate visual reports from the monitoring result data, which can locally generate html format reports containing simple statistical results and line charts.
