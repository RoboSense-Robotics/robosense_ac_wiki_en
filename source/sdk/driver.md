# Driver
## Driver  
Driver is the driver for RoboSense robotic sensor products. It is developed based on C/C++ language, providing users with underlying driver functions, responsible for configuring, initializing, calibrating the device, and implementing hardware device detection and status management, ensuring efficient operation of the sensor. It also provides developer interfaces for the device, supporting sensor configuration, data collection, device control, and other functions, facilitating developers to quickly integrate and use the device.

## ROS Driver  

## ROS2 Driver  
ROS2 driver is a brand new ROS2 package, specifically designed to connect RoboSense robotic sensor products. This driver can run on operating systems with ROS2 environment (humble, jazzy) installed, such as ubuntu18.04/20.04/22.04, Windows, Mac, ARM Debian12, etc.
