# SLAM  
A multi-sensor tightly coupled odometry system that fuses LiDAR, vision, and IMU. Developed based on the FAST-LIVO project open-sourced by the HKU-MARS laboratory, specifically adapted and optimized for Active Camera, it can output the pose of Active Camera in real-time and generate three-dimensional point clouds with color information.
