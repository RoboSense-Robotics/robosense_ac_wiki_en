## FAQ

Q: What are the advantages of the AC1 compared to the combination of RealSense and Mid360?

A: The AC1 offers several advantages over the RealSense and Mid360 combination, particularly by addressing key challenges in multi-sensor fusion with optimized solutions, including:
- **Time Synchronization and Data Alignment**: It resolves issues related to time synchronization and data alignment among multiple sensors, such as differing data acquisition frequencies between LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs, as well as motion distortion compensation.
- **Simplified Calibration Complexity**: It streamlines the calibration process for both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, improves calibration accuracy, and reduces reliance on manual intervention.
- **Improved Multi-Modal Data Fusion Algorithms**: By optimizing heterogeneous data representation and feature matching algorithms, it enhances the accuracy of dynamic object detection while overcoming the limitations of single sensors in specific conditions (e.g., low light, extreme weather).
- **Simplified System Integration and Engineering**: It addresses the inconsistency of protocols and interfaces among different sensors by providing an integrated solution, which lowers integration difficulty and maintenance costs.

In summary, the AC1 and Robosense's AI-ready ecosystem are designed to tackle the critical challenges of multi-sensor fusion, offering developers a more efficient and reliable environmental perception platform.

Q: How well does the device handle high temperatures and water resistance? Can it withstand harsh construction site environments?

A: The Active Camera performs excellently in terms of heat resistance and water protection, making it well-suited for the demanding conditions typically found on construction sites.
- **Operating Temperature Range**: -20°C to +60°C
- **Storage Temperature Range**: -20°C to +70°C
- **Ingress Protection Rating**: IP54

It can operate in environments up to 60°C, which covers most temperature conditions encountered on construction sites.
It is resistant to a certain level of dust and water splashes, though it is not designed for full immersion in water or prolonged exposure to heavy rain.
The IP54 rating effectively prevents construction site dust from entering the sensor, ensuring stable performance.
While not fully waterproof, it is sufficiently protected against common splash scenarios, such as rainfall or water splashes during construction activities.
